# Morse-Code
This is a small repo to help you understand morse code.
There are two programs in these repo :-

### 1 - Morse code encoder
- This program will help you understand what is the output to its corresponding input.
- Type in your input when you are ready.
- Please let the program finish generating the output for a single character then type in another character.
- At the end a text file will be generated to check if your morse code.

### 2 - Morse code decoder
- This program will take in a text file which will be generated after teh executio of the morse_code_encoder program.
- You can check your output which would be displayed after this program executes.

# Warning :-

1) *, /, |, #, !, ", <, >, ~, `, _, ^, % are the special characters which are not supported ny this program.

2) Although morse code is written in capital letters this program will allow small letters to be taken as input, but the output code or decoder will change it to capital letters.

3) Please note there cannot be use of space(' ') in morse code but, even if there is any use of it then the output code or decoder will convert it to non-space output.

### Best way to use this repo :-

- Please wait for the program to generate the output for the input chaaracter then move onward to the next character.
- You will be able to hear the morse code produced in real time , so you can write down the morse code character by character.
- Once your encoding is done, press the "ESC" key to exit the program.
- You can check the morse through the Output text file and compare your results with it.
- And also after encoding you can run the decoder to look up as how your input would look at real time when given through a Morse Embosser.
